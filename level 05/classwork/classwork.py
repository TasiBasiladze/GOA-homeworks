# task 1
#we decleared str type variable and gave it name number, value is "anastasia"
name = "anastasia"

#we have reassigned a value for variable to "tasi"
name = "tasi"
print(name)

#task 2
# 1. snake_case
# 2. case-sensetive
# 3. comments

# 1. snake case makes it easier to read variable name that contains multiple words, programmers discussed and decided to use snake case in python.

# 2. if language is case sensitive, that means that "A" and "a" are different symbols, if we dont pay attention to them, our code can result in error.

# 3. we use comments to explain and give describtion to our code, to make it easier to read and understand.
