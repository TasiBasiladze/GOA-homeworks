# Instance methods take self and work with instance attributes.
# Class methods take cls and work at the class level, created with @classmethod.
# Static methods donâ€™t use self or cls, acting like standalone functions within the class, created with @staticmethod.
# Differences: Instance methods access object data, class methods access class-level data, and static methods 
# are independent utility functions.
