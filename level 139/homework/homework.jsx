// Wrapper component is a container that "wraps" other components.
// It doesnâ€™t have its own visual its main purpose is to render children

// Prop drilling is a situation where data (props)
// is passed down to a deeply nested component only through intermediate components.
// The intermediate components just pass it along, without using it themselves,
// but they still have to receive and forward the props
