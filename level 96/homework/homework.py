#string is immutable

#2
#becouse it doesn't change string, it creates and outputs new one

#3
#no. tuple (), set {}

#4
#no. correct is "i decleared function"

#5
#that means that "a" and "A" is considered as a different characters

#6
#it outputs 2. int(True) = 1, int(False) = 0

#7
#it will output 1000000. "_" is used only for visual and doesn't affect int() function

#9
#Falsey. everything that is empty is falsey in python

#11
#yes we can. example: [i for i in lst if i % 2 == 0]

#12
#yes we can. example: [i if i % 2 == 0 else i ** 2 for i in lst]

#13
#yes we can. example: 
#def outer():
#    def inner():
#        return 1
#    return inner()

#14
#yes, there is. it happens when we are trying to divide something by zero

#15
#anonymous functions

#16
#anonymous functions

#17
#it will output True. "" is empty, so it's False, so not "" == not False == True

#18
#no it wouldn't. everything in python is an object

#19
#no, they are not the same. The == operator compares the values of two objects, while the is operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory

#20
#python is high level programming language. it has the easiest and most human-readable syntax
