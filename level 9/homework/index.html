<h1>JavaScript</h1>
<p><b>JavaScript</b> is a programming language that developers use to create <br>
<u>interactive web pages.</u> Functions can enhance user interaction<br> 
with the website, from <u>updating news feeds on social<br>
media to displaying animations.</u> <br><br></p>

<p>JavaScript scripts are written directly in the <b>HTML</b><br>
text or stored in separate files.<br><br></p>

<p>The history of JavaScript began in <u>1995</u> when <i>Netscape Communications<br>
Corporation</i> hired <i>programmer Brendan Eich</i> to create a scripting language <br>
for their Netscape Navigator browser. Eich decided to develop a new <br>
language that could be embedded in HTML pages and executed on the client side. <br></p>

<h1>Python</h1>
<p><b>Python</b> was created between <u>1989 and 1991</u> by Dutch programmer <i>Guido <br>
van Rossum.</i> It was a hobby project. He started working on it to keep <br>
himself busy during the Christmas holidays.<br><br></p>

<p>Python is used in <u>web applications, software development, data<br> 
science, and machine learning, in web development.</u> It can be used<br>
to create the backend of a web resource that will run on the server. <br></p>

<h1>HTML</h1>
<p><b>HTML</b> is a <i>standardized markup language</i> for <u>creating documents<br>
to be viewed as web pages in a browser.</u> <br><br></p>

<p>HTML was created by British <br>
scientist <i>Tim Berners-Lee</i> between <u>1986 and 1991 in Geneva.</u> It was <br>
designed as a language for <u>exchanging scientific and technical <br>
documentation suitable</u> for use by people who <u>are not specialists <br>
in markup.</u><br></p>

<h1>CSS</h1>
<p>The main purpose of developing <b>CSS</b> is to <u>separate and isolate <br>
the description of the logical structure of a web page</u> (which is<br>
done using HTML or other markup languages) from the description <br>
of the appearance of that web page (which is now done using the<br>
formal language CSS).<br><br></p>

<p>The first mention of CSS appeared in <u>1994</u> when <i>HÃ¥kon Wium Lie</i> proposed<br>
using CSS for the <u>stylistic design of web pages.</u> By <u>December 17, 1996,</u><br>
the first specification <b>(CSS1)</b> was published, and it was recommended <br>
for use by the World Wide Web Consortium <b>(W3C).</b><br></p>

<h1>C++</h1>
<p><b>C++</b> allows for <u>creating applications and programs of any complexity,</u><br>
from simple console utilities to complex game engines. Additionally,<br>
this language can be used to program <u>microcontrollers and real-time systems.</u><br><br></p>

<p>The C++ programming language emerged in the early <u>1980s.</u> <i>Bjarne Stroustrup,</i><br>
an employee of <i>Bell Labs,</i> proposed several improvements to the C programming<br>
language for his own needs. Bjarne Stroustrup was working on queueing theory <br>
for telephone calls at Bell Labs.<br></p>
