#Keep Hydrated!

#Nathan loves cycling.
# Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.
# You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.
# For example:
# time = 3 ----> litres = 1
# time = 6.7---> litres = 3
# time = 11.8--> litres = 5

#Sentence Smash

#Sentence Smash
# Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!
# Example
# ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'

#Find Maximum and Minimum Values of a List

#Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.

# * [4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]         -> max = 566, min = -134
# * [-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110] -> min = -110, max = 56

#You're a square!

# A square of squares
# You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
# However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
# Task
# Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
# In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
# The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
# Examples
# -1  =>  false
#  0  =>  true
#  3  =>  false
#  4  =>  true
# 25  =>  true
# 26  =>  false

#Jaden Casing Strings   

#Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

# Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.
# Example:
# Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
# Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

#Complementary DNA                     

#Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.
# In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).
# Example: (input --> output)

# "GTAT" --> "CATA"
